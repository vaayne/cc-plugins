# Git Commit

Commit small, focused changes with descriptive messages that include emoji and details. Use conventional commit format with appropriate emoji prefixes (e.g., ✨ feat:, 🐛 fix:, ♻️ refactor:, 📝 docs:).

## Steps:

1. Run `git status` to see staged changes
2. Generate commit message following conventional commit format
3. Execute `git commit -m` with the commit message

## Example Commit Types:

- ✨ feat: New features
- 🐛 fix: Bug fixes
- 📝 docs: Documentation changes
- ♻️ refactor: Code restructuring
- 🧑‍💻 chore: Tooling and maintenance
- 🎨 style: Code formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- ⚡️ perf: Performance improvements
- ✅ test: Adding or correcting tests
